# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to help Dana's website provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. These filters will include the data, city, state, country, and state. 

## Results 

The result of this analysis is a website that allows users to narrow down their search using multiple filters. This gives the website the ability to produce specific examples that match user needs.

## Summary 

In summary, the website has improved in capability but there still are drawbacks. Unfortunately, there is no search engine or drop-down menu. This means the user must type what to search which leaves room for error. Dana's website has improved but it still has opportunity for growth :)
